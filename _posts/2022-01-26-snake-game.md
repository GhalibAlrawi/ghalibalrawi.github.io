title: Javascript Snake
---

I made this project during Grade Eight in Robotics class. The rest of the class was making games in Scratch, I thought I could do one better and coded snake in Javascript. [Here](https://crispy-snake.glitch.me/) it is. I also implemented a backend API for keeping record of user scores and user submission of feedback.
